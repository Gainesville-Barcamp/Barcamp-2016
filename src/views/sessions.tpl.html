            This class requires a prior knowledge of Object Orientated concepts
            like classes, we will see how many of the OO ideas can be implemented
            in Javascript. This is vital in building large scale javascript
            (70000 lines of code) that I have been working on for last 2 years.

            D3.js is a powerful data visualization library created by
            Mike Bostock with a very specific purpose: to efficiently
            manipulates documents based on data. Over the past few years the
            library has significantly evolved to position itself as one of
            the most popular tools to visualize data. It's popularity can be
            directly attributed to the large community behind the project
            and the many creative examples that have come up since it was created.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this talk, the speaker will give a brief overview of the library to describe what it is and what it is not. Using a realtime data stream he will demonstrate how to draw simple shapes, how to leverage the power of transitions and how to create different visualizations from the same data set. The demo will use an API to visualize the realtime edits of wikipedia and how the visualization can be used to see patterns in the data.

            Tales from the trenches. When Malcom Gladwell coined the phrase
            "people that are willing to be disagreeable", he was talking about
            me. Not argumentative, not (always) abrasive, but called from a
            young age to seek out leadership blind-spots, all forms of waste,
            misaligned energy and under/over optimized strategies and am happy
            to be the one in the middle of the room with all the fingers of
            disbelief pointed at me. I am okay being disagreeable because
            time and time and time and time again I get to see how quickly
            people start to get it when they are doing transformational
            sized work in their lives or in their world of work.
            But to have a transformational sized experiences there are subtle
            context shifts and belief shifts you have to know about or you will
            likely stay in your own way. Join me for a quick chat on some of
            what I see the most often, some funny, some sad, and all true!

            The QWERTY keyboard was not designed with touchscreens in mind.
            In particular, with the rise of gesture based inputs like Swype and
            Swift Key the shortcomings of QWERTY have become even more pronounced.
            In this talk I'll go over my recent attempts with a colleague to
            algorithmically search for a keyboard layout that minimizes swipe input errors.

            It takes dedication to those you are serving, passion for innovation,
            and intense personal sacrifice. You have to lead by example,
            create spaces in which your community can thrive, and ensure that
            the community you build lasts long after you're gone.
